# SnapText

ðŸ“¸ **SnapText** is a macOS menu bar application that automatically extracts text from screenshots saved on your desktop using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The extracted text is copied to your clipboard for easy use.

## Features

- Automatically detects new screenshots saved on your desktop.
- Extracts text from screenshots using [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
- Copies the extracted text to your clipboard.
- Displays notifications for successful text extraction.
- Allows you to view the last extracted text via the menu bar.
- Deletes processed screenshots to keep your desktop clean.

## Why SnapText?

I came up with this tool while vibing to the **Lofi Girl** YouTube stream and constantly missing the song titles. SnapText lets you screenshot the title, extracts the text, and copies it to your clipboardâ€”so you can stay in the zone without missing a beat.
